# AoC2023
Advent of code 2023 challenges 

## Day 1
#### Synopsis
Process a string to extract the first and last numbers - representing some coordinates.
Part 1: Extract the first and last digits 1 to 9 in the input string
Part 2: Extract the first and last digits 1 to 9 OR the text representaion (i.e. "one", "two", ...)

#### Rating
Part 1: Easy - simple use of Int32 Parse on the input character
Part 2: Hard - repeatedly got the wrong answer, but finally wrote code that emulated what a human does (partly). Processing as a human is pretty easy.
